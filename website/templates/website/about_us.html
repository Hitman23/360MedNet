                The last two decades have seen an unprecedented growth and uptake of mobile and internet use in Africa.
                Health care professionals are constantly faced with the challenge of keeping abreast of the latest research and
                best practices in medicine.

                that bring together people who think differently; Have different skills; have access to varying resources or
                use different approaches but are able to network minds, can foster innovative solutions.
